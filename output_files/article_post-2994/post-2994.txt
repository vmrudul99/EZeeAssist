Quotes
We inspire shift workers to stay longer and to perform better by incentivizing them to do things like show up on time or sell a certain item or improve drive through speed of service.
As team members achieve these goals in the stores, they earn points and they can use those points to redeem all sorts of perks (7:15)
What we care about is celebrating the team member (23:22)
We want to be the best place to work, ever. Lots of companies aspire to have great cultures as they should. It is literally our business, our product to help create this fun and rewarding culture so for us we set the bar very high with our ambitious goal to be the best place to work, ever (27:45)
