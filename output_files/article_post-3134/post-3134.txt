Woven
, the leading multi-unit business management software, announced it has raised
$1.5M
in seed funding led by
Glow Brands
. With this funding, Woven will further accelerate its efforts to streamline people management, operations and facility and asset management for franchisees and independent, multi-unit businesses, globally.
To date, Woven bootstrapped 100% growth, with all customer acquisition coming from word-of-mouth referrals and existing customer expansion, resulting in 98% customer retention over the past five years. The funds raised are earmarked almost entirely for sales and marketing program creation for revenue growth acceleration. Additionally, Woven has been implemented at more than 35% of all
Planet Fitness
clubs, 60% of all Buff City Soap locations, other brands such as
Pet Supplies Plus
and
Great Clips
, and across entire brand footprints, like
Massage Heights
and
Zips Car Wash
.
Multi-unit business management has been a widespread challenge within the franchise industry, resulting in low productivity, high employee turnover and disjointed systems.
With Woven’s platform, businesses can streamline back office work and manage people, locations and operations from a centralized site, enabling multi-unit operators to increase accountability, productivity and consistency.
The most commonly adopted features include internal communications (e.g., team chat, private chat, company announcements), location audits, and employee shift scheduling and labor management.
Scale with ease through Woven’s industry-leading software. Special introductory rate available only through Franchise Supplier Network!
