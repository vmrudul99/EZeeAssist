Ahead of our first of many Supplier Discovery Days in January, we asked our panelists (executives at 5 top marketing supplier brands) what trends they are paying attention to in 2023. Here are just a few of their responses and some great thoughtstarters as you plan for the new year!

“College athletes newly eligible to capitalize on their name, image & likeness (NIL) are excelling as influencers for brands and businesses large and small. In comparison to traditional creators, athletes are 40X more effective at reaching local audiences. With the goal of maximizing local reach and mobilizing engaged fanbases of athletes, we believe NIL changes present a strategic opportunity to create favorable outcomes for franchisors and their franchisees.”
