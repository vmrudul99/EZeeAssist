We hosted our first of many Supplier Discovery Days earlier this month, and it was a great webinar event. Our panel of marketing supplier executives shared a TON of marketing tips & tools for the year ahead – here were some of our key takeaways:
The time is now to
move beyond basic measurement KPIs
(impressions, conversions) and evaluate customer lifetime value, profitability and other revenue-based KPIs to assess your marketing.
Tapping into
athletes as content creators
connects local franchise locations to the spirit and culture surrounding fans’ favorite school/team, delivering impact through positive associations.
The importance of
data mining
and using this to target & convert your ideal client and ideal potential franchisee.
Artificial intelligence is shattering writers block and empowering franchisees to
generate captions and contribute local content
on social channels.
With the recent iOS 14 privacy changes and the end of cookies,
having your own database of customer information
for which to engage and target is going to be critical.
