It’s Women’s History Month and it gives us a great excuse to recognize powerful women in franchising and highlight their achievements. According to Entrepreneur, 31% of successful franchises are owned and operated by women. This number is only expected to grow. In recent data, women have now outnumbered men in seeking information about franchise ownership, especially among Gen X and Gen Y.
Here are just of a few of the powerhouse women in our supplier network:
