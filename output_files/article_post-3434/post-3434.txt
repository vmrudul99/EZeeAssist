Over the last 6 months, Franchise Supplier Network has been working with many franchisors to understand their strategic initiatives, projects and requirements for the short and longer term of their franchise network.
One of the running themes is around employee recruitment, training, engagement, satisfaction and retention. With the goal of Franchise Supplier Network to live at the intersection of franchisors and suppliers, we have taken the feedback from our
Franchisor Assessment Surveys
and Ideation sessions, and grouped together suppliers that revolve around the
EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE
.
For our latest Supplier Discovery Day series, we identified 9 current (and growing) suppliers that we feel can truly impact and enhance the employee experience:
