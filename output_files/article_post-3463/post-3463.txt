The future is here, and it’s powered by Artificial Intelligence (A.I.).
Over recent months, we’ve found ourselves discussing this powerhouse of a tool with our franchise partners and supplier members.
The burning question: How can we harness the potential of A.I. to propel our franchisees forward and significantly boost revenue?
Get ready to take a deep dive into the intersection of A.I. and social media for franchise organizations in our upcoming Supplier Discovery Day.
We have invited three industry experts at
Rallio
,
Consumer Fusion
&
Eulerity
to share their insights on the subject. This is your chance to be the first to access our exclusive recorded workshop and gain a competitive edge!
We’ll be exploring the use of A.I. for paid and organic social media, and reputation management – all in a SAFE and brand-compliant way. Be among the first to discover some of the newest A.I.-supported tools these franchise vendors have rigorously battle-tested.
Envision your franchisees operating with a “copilot,” a tool that customizes and localizes your recommended brand playbook. This AI-driven assistant saves franchisees significant time and resources. By eliminating the common excuses of “I’m too busy” or “I don’t know where to start,” (and matching that with franchisor level brand compliance guidelines that are pre trained in the model), A.I. can truly revolutionize your franchise operations.
Ready to leap into the future?
