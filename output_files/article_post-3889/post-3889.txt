Here’s what a few of those franchisor client have to say about working with Purple Penguin Digital:
“We have been using Purple Penguin Digital for several months now and have had a wonderful experience. Our small business has started receiving frequent phone calls from potential clients, and these people say they found us online. This rarely, if EVER, happened before using Purple Penguin Digital. We utilize their Google Ad services, and they have been very impressive. One thing I like most is that I can log on and see the analytics of how our Google Ad is performing and what key words are being used. John Marsh has been incredibly professional and has stayed in touch throughout the process. He always takes my calls and responds to emails promptly. I have already recommended Purple Penguin Digital to other small business owners, and I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking to build their business.” – Christina H., Franchise Owner
“Since starting with Purple Penguin, we have seen our online presence grow and conversions from website into store have followed. The ROI was near immediate and we haven’t looked back. I look forward to a long working relationship with Purple Penguin as we move forward and continue to scale the business. Highly recommend!” – Kyle D., Franchise Owner
