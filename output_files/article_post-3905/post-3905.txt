SeoSamba
, a leading provider of comprehensive marketing automation solutions, is thrilled to announce a significant upgrade to its Blog and Press Release tool, incorporating cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.
The latest update makes producing content centrally for distributed website networks like franchises a breeze and enables agencies and business providers with a white-label license to offer AI-powered content generation right into their solution set.
SeoSamba’s platform, Franchise Marketing Operating System, enables AI-powered content generation that can be geo-targeted to enhance local relevancy for local franchisees and point of sales while preserving branding and message’s essence consistency. By using the same AI algorithms, businesses can maintain a unified brand voice and messaging, regardless of the number of websites they manage.
This not only enhances brand recognition but also improves the overall user experience for customers.  Jason Kaber, VP of Business Development comments “Many franchisors are unaware of the benefits offered by combining a strong corporate domain presence with a web of local franchisees sites. And when they come to realize the potential they are missing out on, wary marketers usually oppose their inability to generate unique content at scale. With the latest SeoSamba FMOS upgrade, this can not be further from the truth.”
