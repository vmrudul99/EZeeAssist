Map Ranks
is a Local SEO company that works with franchise brands to improve their online presence using Google Maps. They have worked with brands like Tint World, Dogtopia, Detail Garage, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, CoolVu, FastSigns and Marcos Pizza,
just to name a few.
Their approach to Local SEO involves in-depth keyword research, profile optimization, regular updates & posts, reviews management, photos management, and citation (directory listing) building for multi-location brands and franchises.
Map Ranks has discovered that Google’s very own FOI or “Frequency of Interaction” algorithm demands that businesses regularly post content and updates onto their Google Business Profiles. Therefore, they offer a managed service that handles these regular updates, content posts, photo uploads and reviews for brands that don’t have the resources to do it in-house, or for franchisees that don’t know how to do it themselves.
