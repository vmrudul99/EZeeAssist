Just in time for the holidays – how about a little feel good news?
For the last 20 years, Mike Bann from
Bann Business Solutions
has helped run a volunteer Christmas tree lot. Over that time he has helped raise $1 million in funds to be donated to the children of a private school in St Paul MN.
In the early years, the lot sold anywhere from 200 – 500 trees a year. This year, Mike and his team will market about 3,000 trees (Balsam, Frazier, Canaan, Douglass, White Pine and more). Over the next 4 weeks, the lot will generate an estimated donation of $100,000 this year.
Have you ever heard the phrase of “doing well while doing good”? With a large display tree, fire pit, decorative lights, hot chocolate, cider, snacks, theme nights and most of Santa’s favorite adult beverages, this sounds like one place you can’t help but have a festive time.
Thanks for all the good you’re doing, Mike!
