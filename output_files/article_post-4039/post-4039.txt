Upon its founding in 2013,
ServiceMinder
had one mission in mind: to help home service (and commercial service) franchise businesses acquire and convert more leads, schedule more appointments, close more deals and communicate with clients more effectively.
They also strive to be more than “just a vendor” for their clients, including Cabinet IQ. Cabinet IQ is a high-tech cabinet and countertop home services franchise that prides itself on providing a five-star customer experience.
Read below for how ServiceMinder helped them grow!
What They Needed
In September of 2022, Cabinet IQ met the ServiceMinder team at the Springboard Emerging and Re-emerging Franchisor Conference. Following this encounter, Cabinet IQ successfully concluded their six-month-long quest for a suitable CRM solution. Having experienced disappointment with three previous CRM options, primarily due to integration conflicts, inadequate scheduling features, and the unmanageable use of five different solutions, Cabinet IQ had identified precisely what they sought in a CRM. Their previous frustrations with other vendors had equipped them with a checklist of requirements that we were able to fulfill!

What They Said
”As an emerging brand, we still don’t know everything about the franchising space yet. ServiceMinder was able to solve problems we didn’t even know we had!” – Jacob Collums (VP of Franchise & Development)
Our Partnership
Despite having a well-defined vision of the necessary features, as an emerging brand, they were pleasantly surprised that ServiceMinder applied industry insights as a strategic partner rather than just another vendor. In November of 2022, Cabinet IQ officially partnered with ServiceMinder. With ServiceMinder’s comprehensive approach, Cabinet IQ transitioned from managing daily operations across five distinct platforms to a single, unified solution. After thorough training and workflow configuration, all locations were launched by August 2023. Less than a year into their ServiceMinder journey, Cabinet IQ launched two new locations.
Next Steps for Cabinet IQ
The team is looking forward to utilizing automation both internally and client-facing to enhance the client experience. Cabinet IQ is eager to share ServiceMinder with future franchisees.
