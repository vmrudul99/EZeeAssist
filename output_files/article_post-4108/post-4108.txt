“In order to operate a profitable detailing business, you have to have systems in place that make your scheduling, communication with customers, and accepting payments easy and fast. My solution for the past 4 years has been PocketSuite. Pocketsuite is an online booking app that allows you to do all the things I mentioned and more. From recurring automated messages that allow you to automatically send reminder to your clients to simple payment processing and the ability to add a tipping option! Using pocketsuite has allowed me to free up more time that was spent on running the back end business stuff, which allows me to be more focused and detail more! ENJOY!!!”
